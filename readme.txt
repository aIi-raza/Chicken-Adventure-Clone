# Chicken Adventure – C++ & SFML Game Project

This repository contains my second semester university project: a simple 2D shooting game developed using **C++** and **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The game is inspired by the classic *Chicken Invaders* many of us played during childhood.

> **Note:** This project is a snapshot of my early game development experience. It is not a complete game, but represents my learning progress at the time.

### Features:
- Spaceship movement and basic shooting
- Enemy waves (no power-ups or enemy attacks yet)

- Enemies don't shoot back
- Nothing happens after defeating final boss

---

### Note from Me:
I'm proud of what I achieved at this stage.  
Even though it’s incomplete, it's a huge milestone in my learning journey.  
No further updates are planned — this repo is just to showcase my progress.

### Built With:
- C++
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
